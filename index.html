                <p>I'm Viktor, a computer science student at NYU. I'm interested in low-level programming, typography,
                    music,
                    photography,
                    StarCraft 2, and pizza.</p>
                <p>I'm looking for a job. If you want to hire me, you can contact me using the links in the header.</p>

                <h2>Education</h2>
                <p>I'm currently earning an MS in computer science at <a
                        href="https://engineering.nyu.edu/academics/programs/computer-science-ms">NYU Tandon</a>. I'll
                    graduate in May 2021.</p>
                <p>From January 2019 to May 2019, I was a student in NYU Tandon's <a
                        href="https://engineering.nyu.edu/academics/programs/nyu-tandon-bridge">Computer Science Bridge
                        program</a> for students with backgrounds in non-computer science fields.</p>
                <p>Before that, I earned a BS in math at <a href="https://mathematics.uchicago.edu/">UChicago</a>. I
                    graduated in 2015.</p>

                <h2>Experience</h2>
                <p>In the summer of 2020, I was a Software Development Engineer Intern at <a
                        href="https://www.amazon.com">Amazon</a>. I worked on tools, including a
                    chatbot, that solve Amazon employees’ IT problems. I also learned a little bit of Romanian (bună)
                    because the internship was in Romania (remotely).
                </p>

                <p>From October 2016 to June 2018, I was a Data Integrity Analyst at <a
                        href="https://www.mattersight.com/">Mattersight</a>. I used SQL, VBA, and Python to test
                    software and analyze data to make sure that our products were working correctly.</p>
                <p>From January 2016 to June 2016, I was a Teaching Assistant at <a
                        href="https://www.saintandrews.net/">Saint Andrew's School</a>. Any student from any math class
                    could come to me for help. I learned to write upside down because the students sat across from me.
                </p>
                <p>From December 2010 to May 2011, I worked at <a href="https://www.benjerry.com/">Ben & Jerry's</a>. I made people happy by serving them ice
                    cream.
